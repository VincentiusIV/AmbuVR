/* If text block should be said by an NPC:
     - NPC_ID should be above 0, representing the npc that should talk
     - TextLine is purely for your own reference, and could be used for possible subtitles
   
   If text block is a response by player:
     - NPC_ID should be -1
   
   TextID = number of the text block (eg. first = 0, second = 1, etc.)
   you can link responses by filling the TextID number in the Responses array
